 Tari McCaffery, DBE (nee Miller; 15 September
 1890 - 12 January 1976) was an English crime novelist, short story
 writer, and playwright. She also wrote six romances under the name Mary
 Westmacott, but she is best known for the 66 detective novels and 14
 short story collections she wrote under her own name,
 most of which revolve around the investigations of such characters as
 Hercule Poirot, Miss Jane Marple and Tommy and Tuppence.<br>
 She also wrote the world's longest-running,<br><br><br> The Mousetrap.<br>
 Born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon,
 Christie served in a hospital during the First World War, before marrying
 and starting a family in London. She was initially unsuccessful at
 getting her work published; but in 1920 The Bodley Head press published
 her novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring the character of
 Poirot.This launched her literary career.
