Writers can be insecure creatures.
For many, the thought of beginning a novel,
a project requiring the production of from 60,000 to 100,000 words,
can be overwhelming. For the writer who tends to linger over every
sentence, the prospect can be especially daunting.<br/><br/>

This year is NaNoWriMo
has already begun, but it is not too late for a writer who has been
flirting with beginning a novel to register. Not everyone who
participates in the online event completes the challenge,
but taking part for just one or two weeks is an enlightening writing
exercise.<br/><br/>

If you have never heard of NaNoWriMo, you may be the only writer
who has not. The acronym is for National Novel Writing Month.
Do not let the name fool you. The online event has become a worldwide
phenomenon. The name will no doubt remain the same because it is so much
fun to say "naa-no-wry-mo".<br/><br/>

The value of this worldwide writing exercise
is that it encourages writers to recognize the duality of the writing
process. Every writer wears two hats: the Creator's hat and the Editor's
hat.(Nowadays most writers must don the Marketer's hat as well,
but that is a subject for another post.)
