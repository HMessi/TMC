Writing is one of the loneliest pursuits (or professions), and as I know
as well as anyone, enthusiasm for expressing oneself is tempered by the
daunting challenge of actually doing it. For those of us for whom having
written a novel is a more appealing prospect than, you know, actually
writing it, National Novel Writing Month provides a quirky motivating
nudge.<br/><br/>

The annual event, which encourages writers to complete the first draft of
a novel in thirty days with the knowledge that one can publicly celebrate
one's progress while embracing the morale-boosting benefit of knowing
that one is part of a worldwide community of fellow scribes, is in its
fourteenth year.<br/><br/>

Last time around, more than a quarter million people participated from
all over planet Earth. Only one out of seven hit the 50,000-word goal,
but every one of them started — and as we all realize, the first step is
the hardest. (More than a hundred NaNoWriMo participants have had the
novels they worked on for the event published — again, not everyone, but
enough to make it reasonable to imagine that someday you number among
them.)<br/><br/>
